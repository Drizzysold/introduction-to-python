## Assignment 2
### Variables, Functions and Conditional Statements

Write a program to simulate an ATM.

The program should prompt the user in an infinite loop with 3 options
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Show balance

The program should be able to warn the user when user input amount is less than zero or 
below available funds during withdrawal.
Your program should behave as the sample input/output screenshots shown below.

You may use the python's built-in function `float(str)` to convert user supplied input to a decimal (`float`) number.
Please keep in mind that float types have its limitations https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html

You may use the python built-in function `round(float, 2)` to 2 decimal places to mitigate the float limitations for 
the purpose of this assignment
