## Assignment 4
### Practice exercies

1. Given 2 timestamps (start_hour, start_minute, end_hour, end_minute), return the number of minutes in between the 2 timestamps.
   Assume the hour will be in 24hr format, and period cannot be greater than 24 hours, but might cut across different dates (i.e. 22:30 to 01:30)
   
2. Write a function to generate the first n numbers of the fibonacci series?
   n = (n - 1) + (n - 2), and n0 = 0, n1 = 1

3. Given a list of numbers, return the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list

4. Given a list of numbers, and a limit value, return a new list containing only the numbers in the list less than the limit value

5. Given a list of numbers, return a new list in the opposite direction.  Example input [1, 4, 3, 2, 5], output should be [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]

6. Given a list of numbers, return a new list where the position of the numbers are shifted by one to the right.
   Example input [1, 4, 3, 2, 5], output should be [5, 1, 4, 3, 2]

7. Same as above, except the number of positions to shift is given as a parameter n.

8. Given a list of numbers, return the nth odd number in the list.  Example list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 3, output must be 5

9. Given the slope m, y-intercept b, and integers xMin, xMax, return a list of numbers in the order [y(xMin), .., y(xMax)]

10. Given a list of numbers, return a new list containing only the numbers that occur once in the list?
    Example input [1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 3, 5] output [2, 7]
